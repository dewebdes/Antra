_"Antra," inspired by an ancient tale, represents the mystical serpent symbolizing wisdom, bravery, and inner strength. In this legend, Antra was a magical snake that illuminated the paths of heroes in search of hidden treasures during the darkness of night. It stood as a beacon, transforming obscurity into light and unveiling concealed mysteries. The name "Antra" became synonymous with enlightenment and decoding secrets, embodying the power of transformation and creation wherever it ventured._

This project takes its inspiration from Antra, serving as a guiding tool for uncovering insights, analyzing data, and making informed decisions in the world of cryptocurrency markets.

## Features

### **1. proxy24m.py**

- **Purpose**: Manages request proxies using 240 worker nodes, employing MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) techniques for handling large-scale requests efficiently.
- **Use Case**: Enables the seamless routing of requests through multiple proxies to avoid rate limits or network bottlenecks.

### **2. redproxy2.js**

- **Purpose**: Acts as a specialized proxy handler tailored for cl-workers, ensuring reliable and secure request routing.
- **Use Case**: Supports the ecosystem of scripts reliant on proxy-based operations for enhanced network stability.

### **3. fetchCoinData.js**

- **Purpose**: Fetches continuous kline (candlestick) data for all coins, saving it for subsequent analytical use.
- **Use Case**: Serves as the backbone for collecting historical and real-time data crucial for market analysis.

### **4. signal.js**

- **Purpose**: Conducts deep market analysis, ranking coins based on potential pump factors and generating HTML reports.
- **Additional Features**:
  - Sorts coins based on multiple factors like volume, rank, and price fluctuations.
  - Evaluates market execution strategies.
  - Outputs data in a detailed, color-coded HTML log.
- **Use Case**: Perfect for identifying coins with promising market opportunities.

### **5. apiconnect.js**

- **Purpose**: Enhances the HTML logs generated by `signal.js` with dynamic interactivity, enabling users to highlight and interact with specific coins.
- **Use Case**: Provides seamless backend communication for live updates and user interaction.

### **6. api.js**

- **Purpose**: Independently evaluates the potential of a coin's market execution based on provided funds and transaction thresholds.
- **Use Case**: A standalone tool for gauging whether a market is worth exploring for investments.

### **7. pond.js**

- **Purpose**: Analyzes a coin’s behavior using Fibonacci retracements and historical kline data to determine trends and key price points.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for traders seeking detailed Fibonacci analysis and trend insights.

### **8. fibonacci_alert.js**

- **Purpose**: Extends the functionalities of `pond.js` by:
  - Adding real-time HTML log updates.
  - Generating audio alerts for significant price movements (e.g., critical dump points).
  - Streamlining data visualization with a cleaner UI.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for real-time monitoring of price trends with actionable alerts.

### **9. coin_vs_btc.js**

- **Purpose**: Compares the pump/dump behavior of multiple coins against BTC, ranking them based on their likelihood of pumping.
- **Additional Features**:
  - Outputs a ranked HTML log.
  - Adds a "Pump Day" column for quick reference on days with significant opportunities.
- **Use Case**: Designed for comparative analysis of coin performance relative to BTC trends.

### **10. btc_price_estimator.js**

- **Purpose**: Predicts a coin's price when BTC reaches a specified target price, analyzing their historical correlation and change rates.
- **Use Case**: Assists in projecting future prices based on Bitcoin’s market movements.

### **11. klines_trend_analysis.py**

- **Purpose**: Uses logarithmic regression models to predict long-term price trends for cryptocurrencies based on historical data.
- **Use Case**: Enables long-term strategizing for investors by forecasting prices over extended periods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running any scripts, make sure to set up the required environment and proxy.

### **MITM Proxy Setup**

Most scripts rely on a proxy server for handling requests. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Install MITM Proxy Server**:

   - On Windows, download and install the MITM proxy server from [mitmproxy.org](https://mitmproxy.org/).

2. **Install Python MITM Package**:

   ```bash
   py -m pip install mitmproxy
   ```

3. **Start the MITM Proxy Server**:

   - Run the following command to start the server:
     ```bash
     & "C:\Program Files\mitmproxy\bin\mitmweb.exe" --set block_global=false --ssl-insecure --listen-port 8082 -s proxy24m.py
     ```
   - This command:
     - Disables global blocking.
     - Ignores SSL certificates.
     - Sets the proxy listening port to `8082`.
     - Loads the `proxy24m.py` script to handle proxy operations.

4. **Verify Proxy Setup**:
   - Ensure your proxy is active and running before executing any scripts.
